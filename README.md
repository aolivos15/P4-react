# "Dulces Migajas" coffee shop website

## Description

This project is a web app for a ficticious coffee shop called "Dulces Migajas", made to practice using React and NoSQL databases. There is a home page with a description of the coffee shop, a featured products section and a contact form where users can send messages. There is also a booking page where users can make reservations for the coffee shop, which are stored in a Firestore database. This page consists of a calendar where users can pick a date, several buttons for them to choose one of the available time blocks for the date they have picked, and a form for them to enter the rest of the info to make their reservation.
